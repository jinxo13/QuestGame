    Thanks for playing!

descr_mage: |
    Not one to heft a sword in battle, Mages are happy to rain down spells from afar.
    It's best not to anger a Mage, unless you'd like to spend the rest of your life on a lilypad.
    Mages favour a trusty staff, a nice warm robe, and won't get physical if a spell will do.
    Key traits are their wisdom and intelligence, and a penchant for pie.

descr_thief: |
    Keep your eye on a thief, they're likely to steal your purse or try and stab you in the back, probably both.
    Thiefs favour short blades, are handy with a bow, and light armor.
    Thiefs key traits are their dexterity and intelligence, and an eye for expensive jewelry.

descr_fighter: |
    Fighters have a straight forward approach - fight first talk later.
    Fighters favour two handed or long weapons, heavy armor and a trusty shield.
    Fighters key traits are strength and health. "tiz but a flesh wound" is often the favourite words of a fighter.

descr_ranger: |
    Rangers are most at home in the forest, roasting a rabbit on a spit.
    Rangers favour the long or composite bows, and are handy with short blades, and prefer light or medium armor.
    Rangers key traits are strength and dexterity, and tracking mud all over the new rug.
